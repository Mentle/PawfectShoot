# Pawfect Project: Planning and Roadmap

This document outlines the current status of the Pawfect project, summarizes completed work, and defines a roadmap for future development.

## Project Overview

The Pawfect project is an interactive web application that combines a 3D virtual art gallery with a Tamagotchi-style pet game. The primary goal is to engage users with a fun, interactive experience that ultimately encourages them to book a professional pet photography session.

The application is built using `three.js` for the 3D gallery and standard HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the game and UI. It is currently hosted on GitHub Pages, which implies a static front-end architecture.

## Completed Work

Based on our development so far, the following features have been successfully implemented:

### 3D Gallery Experience

- **Virtual Room:** A 3D room has been created to serve as the main gallery space.
- **Gallery Navigation:** Users can rotate the view within the room using on-screen arrow buttons and keyboard arrow keys.
- **Dynamic Gallery Wall:** The main gallery wall features a vertically scrolling texture of photographs. 
    - **Automatic Scrolling:** The gallery scrolls automatically.
    - **Manual Scroll Control:** Users can manually scroll using the mouse wheel or touch-and-drag gestures.
    - **Pause on Interact:** The automatic scrolling pauses when the user clicks and holds on the gallery wall.
- **Visual Enhancements:**
    - **Procedural Flooring:** The floor features a procedurally generated wooden plank texture, optimizing load times by avoiding external image files.
    - **Consistent Lighting:** The lighting has been simplified to a constant, even illumination across all views for a consistent user experience.
    - **Optimized Opacity:** Gallery elements are set to 100% opacity to ensure textures are always fully visible.
    - **High-Contrast Walls:** The non-gallery walls are a dark charcoal gray to make the artwork stand out.

### Tamagotchi Game & Booking Funnel

- **Full Game Flow:** A complete Tamagotchi-style game flow is integrated into the experience:
    1.  **Pet Selection:** Users can choose from different types of animals.
    2.  **Size and Name:** Users can select a size and give their new pet a name.
    3.  **Interaction:** The main game screen allows users to feed, play with, and care for their pet.
- **Booking Integration:** The game serves as a direct funnel to the booking process.
    - **Booking Packages:** Users are presented with clear "PAWSIC" and "PAWFECT" photography packages.
    - **Booking Summary:** A summary screen confirms the user's choices before prompting for contact.
    - **Contact Options:** Buttons are in place for contacting via Email or WhatsApp.

## Future Planning & Roadmap

The following are proposed next steps to enhance the project. 

### High Priority: Core Functionality

1.  **Implement Contact/Booking Backend:** The "Contact via Email" and "Contact via WhatsApp" buttons are currently placeholders. 
    - **Action:** Since the site is on GitHub Pages, we must use a serverless approach.
    - **Email:** Integrate a service like **EmailJS** or create a serverless function (e.g., using Netlify Functions, Vercel Functions, or AWS Lambda) that sends an email notification when a user clicks the button.
    - **WhatsApp:** Implement a `mailto:` link for the email button and a WhatsApp click-to-chat link (`https://wa.me/`) for the WhatsApp button. This is the simplest, most effective client-side solution.

### Medium Priority: UI/UX & Refinements

2.  **Code Refactoring & Organization:** The JavaScript files (`main.js`, `tamagotchi_game.js`) have grown large. 
    - **Action:** Break down the code into smaller, more manageable ES6 modules. For example:
        - `three-scene.js`: Manages the core 3D scene setup, lighting, and camera.
        - `gallery.js`: Handles all logic for the gallery wall, scrolling, and interaction.
        - `tamagotchi-ui.js`: Manages the DOM elements and screen transitions for the game.
        - `tamagotchi-state.js`: Manages the game's state (pet's stats, choices, etc.).
3.  **Improve User Feedback:** Enhance UI responsiveness.
    - **Action:** Add subtle animations or visual cues for button clicks, screen transitions, and successful actions within the Tamagotchi game (e.g., a "+" icon when feeding).

### Low Priority: Feature Expansion

4.  **Tamagotchi Game Persistence:** The game currently resets on every visit.
    - **Action:** Use `localStorage` to save the user's pet and its state, allowing them to return later and continue where they left off. This would significantly increase engagement.
5.  **Expand 3D Interactivity:** Make the 3D room more engaging.
    - **Action:** Consider adding more interactive objects. For example, clicking on a specific photo on the gallery wall could open a larger view or a modal with more information.
